## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that transforms broadcast football video into structured spatiotemporal tracking data for tactical and physical analysis.

## Pipeline Architecture
- Player detection and multi-object tracking
- Spatial normalization to pitch coordinates
- Feature engineering from movement trajectories
- Unsupervised clustering and sequence-based modeling

## Machine Learning Focus
- Clustering for positional roles and spatial behavior patterns
- Sequence modeling for temporal movement dynamics

## Scalability
The pipeline is designed to scale across matches and teams, with clear extensions toward event detection, team classification, and learned calibration.
